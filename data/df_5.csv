From Wikipedia:

What counts as a reliable source
Further information: Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources
The word """"source"""" in Wikipedia has three meanings:

the type of the work (some examples include a document, an article, or a book)
the creator of the work (for example, the writer)
the publisher of the work (for example, Oxford University Press).
All three can affect reliability.

Base articles on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is """"made available to the public in some form"""".[6] Unpublished materials are not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. The best sources have a professional structure in place for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.

If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources, such as in history, medicine, and science.

Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:

university-level textbooks
books published by respected publishing houses
magazines
journals
mainstream newspapers.

  
Editors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria.

Norman Lowell: """"The highest authority within the Imperium will be the Elite. A body of Men, a quarter of a million: guardians of the Imperium. These leaders, veritable SuperMen, are all male, imbued with a Sacred High Dominance quite apart, distinct, distanced from the Nation... Authority vested in the Elite must be absolute or it is no authority at all. It is unconditional, not subject to any other power or right. It is not subject to the law but above it.""""

""""All trade with those outside the Imperium will have to be approved by the Central Economic Policy Staff, under the authority of the Elite""""

"""".. They will have to go disarmed and will never to allowed to re-arm. A constant air and naval surveillance program will ensure this. They will not be allowed to export or import. They will be made to learn to just live and let live.""""

Freedom from coercion is the fundamental principle of libertarianism. Lowell's Utopia guarantees nothing of the sort: it will be a coercive, lawless tyranny of the """"Elite"""", Prussian warlords or something of the sort. It will oppress and dominate weaker """"races"""". It will have a Central Economic Policy Staff, whose functions will be control of the markets.

Just because this hopelessly schizoid neo-Nazi supports capitalism for a privileged group does not mean he's a Libertarian. Libertarianism goes way further than free markets for a chosen few. It's an ideology of freedom. This sick fuck's ideology is ideology of tyranny.

He's not a libertarian and never will be - schizophrenia is not really curable at the moment.""",0.9684,0,0,"`` Libertarianism : `` '' political philosophy [ 1 ] advocating individual free wish person property , long infringe liberty .

Yes, they are way too expensive, but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms. As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon - I've got some more unsightly bulges than that, and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry. So, women have an easier time to carry guns.   God, I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse. But then again, it looks like total ass.  Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. Because violence is the very foundation of a state - The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. As such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.""","""

As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon - I've got some more unsightly bulges than that, and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry. So, women have an easier time to carry guns. 

God, I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse. But then again, it looks like total ass.

Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. Because violence is the very foundation of a state - The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. As such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.""",-0.9964,0,0,"`` Follow-up . reduce `` '' false rape '' '' claim people ( woman ) changing mind . rape sex consent , require changing mind . people feeling ambivalent curious .

""""The Soveriegn Independent"""" is hardly a reliable source, but just one these infinite slanted political outlets claiming to be """"alternative news"""". Russia Today is notoriously unreliable as well with load of nonsense news about aliens making it look more like Weekly World News that a source of information.  In addition the Florida Living Magazine article is basically an interview with Fresco, and therefore the source is Fresco himself, and as such it may break WP:BLPSPS. That goes for Jack Roberts Miami news article as well, but at least it's used much less as a source. And that article works fine as a source for him being called a dreamer, though. ) And why did you add Frescos claim of making a car with only 32 moving parts, not not his claim of inventing a 3D TV with picture so real you could feel you could touch it? ;-)     I considered whether some of the news articles will be reliable beings they use Fresco's word as their source. But in many instances, the citation is doubled up and the claim/information is cross referenced between those two sources. But if some is unacceptable then we will have to make adjustments.    Maybe it can be rescued if we point out that it's his claims and we say that he *claimed* to develop a car with only 32 moving parts. We have no source for this except two interviews with him, one which he also seems to claim to have invented 3D TV, that articles' reliability is maybe not as high as we want it to be. But I suspect that in biographies we shouldn't have personal claims even if we mar them as such, but somebody with more BLP experience than me should make that call.     There are some parts of the article regarding the theory of The Venus Project that I disagree with, but on the whole it seems to be an outstanding piece of work. There is a lot of stuff about Jacque Fresco that I would have never known about if this article had never been written. Very nice, short, interesting biography; well done. I like it.  (  )  For the most part, I copied that info from the Venus Project article. I plan on expanding the Venus Project article to cover more of the theory, and will then modify the info for it on the Fresco page.  ""","""

""""The Soveriegn Independent"""" is hardly a reliable source, but just one these infinite slanted political outlets claiming to be """"alternative news"""". Russia Today is notoriously unreliable as well with load of nonsense news about aliens making it look more like Weekly World News that a source of information.  In addition the Florida Living Magazine article is basically an interview with Fresco, and therefore the source is Fresco himself, and as such it may break WP:BLPSPS. That goes for Jack Roberts Miami news article as well, but at least it's used much less as a source. And that article works fine as a source for him being called a dreamer, though. ) And why did you add Frescos claim of making a car with only 32 moving parts, not not his claim of inventing a 3D TV with picture so real you could feel you could touch it? ;-)   

I considered whether some of the news articles will be reliable beings they use Fresco's word as their source. But in many instances, the citation is doubled up and the claim/information is cross referenced between those two sources. But if some is unacceptable then we will have to make adjustments.  

Maybe it can be rescued if we point out that it's his claims and we say that he *claimed* to develop a car with only 32 moving parts. We have no source for this except two interviews with him, one which he also seems to claim to have invented 3D TV, that articles' reliability is maybe not as high as we want it to be. But I suspect that in biographies we shouldn't have personal claims even if we mar them as such, but somebody with more BLP experience than me should make that call.   

There are some parts of the article regarding the theory of The Venus Project that I disagree with, but on the whole it seems to be an outstanding piece of work. There is a lot of stuff about Jacque Fresco that I would have never known about if this article had never been written. Very nice, short, interesting biography; well done. I like it.  (  )

For the most part, I copied that info from the Venus Project article. I plan on expanding the Venus Project article to cover more of the theory, and will then modify the info for it on the Fresco page.  """,0.9762,0,0,"`` ... . article Jacque Fresco removed ...

That and other things are outlined at WP:TPG and help make sure things stay ordered. For content on the EAB page, there's a bit behind all those edits I made awhile back, so stick with me:  I realize a lot of stuff I condensed was your previous work, but right now everything seems to fit together well. The merging was mainly based on parsing things down, but also how we deal with scientific content at Wikipedia. It's definitely the ideal for Wikipedia articles in general that we summarize what the scientific consensus is on topics such as this. If you haven't already, I highly suggest reading WP:SCIRS, which gives a good outline on what we should be trying to do with scientific content. Essentially, we're striving to summarize what other reliable sources say for an encyclopedia. That means pulling from review articles since they do that for us. However, part of that is because we don't generally regard primary sources (i.e. research articles) as reliable because those are communications within the scientific community. That's because those articles are intended for other researchers to evaluate, and the general public (e.g. Wikipedia editors) are not qualified to assess whether the study was valid. For us as Wikipedia editors, we cannot assign what we call due WP:WEIGHT to an idea or specific study until it's put in context through other researchers commenting on it or giving it validity (e.g. review articles). Now an introduction section can count as a mini-review article, but we generally don't need that in this topic since we have a few review articles to pull from.   With all that said, it is not our goal to describe what the primary research is. That's why I cut down a lot of the content as it was reading more like a journal than an encyclopedia (see WP:NOTJOURNAL). It's very different writing content for say an academic paper than it is for a Wikipedia article. From what I've gathered about your edits, you're very interested in generating very detailed information, which is perfectly normal for someone just getting their feet wet on scientific content here. However, the general goal of an encyclopedia is to have summarized information with references that lead to the more detailed information. A lot of the edits you're probably interested in including still largely fall under that question of due weight such as whether we even include the content or how much detail does it get. It's a learned skill, so I'm happy to explain things further at the EAB page is it's directly related or here if it's more general (i.e. Wikipedia's policies and guidelines) if you have questions or something isn't clear.

And the reason that it DOES matter as to the point I made about other encyclopedias not accusing or even mentioning Steiner's racial views is that these encyclopedias are the mainstream academic viewpoints. This is important to establish because yours, like those of the flat-earth society, are the opinions of the tiny minority.
""""Views held only by a tiny minority of people should not be represented as though they are significant minority views, and perhaps should not be represented at all.""""
Honestly, I think you lost this one Pete. I'm prepared to edit the section down to Wikipedia standards unless you can convince me otherwise. And that means convince me using Wikipedia guidelines, not your opinions.

You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see, that no one supported your decision. This caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence.

 Response to HJ Mitchells """"challenge"""" 

Since I am still blocked and cannot post this in response to HJ's challenge nor can I vote for the three candidates I do support, I will leave this here.
Hj Mitchell, please spare us the dramatics of, """"I'll quite if you give me a reason."""" No one here thinks you will quite regardless of any reasons given nor would you be expected too. You are also fully aware that no one is going to mine through your edits looking for wrongdoing. That's just a waste of time and you would likely retort with they are NOTHERE. What I will do, is give you a few examples of what I have seen over a very short span of time. Given a review of any say, month long period, I think we will find the same result within a few percentage points of the mean.
You made an obviously bad call about Protonk, a well respected and long term contributor to this project based on what you term a BLP violation. You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see, that no one supported your decision. This caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence.

0,23,1896,""" Reading the above and looking at the editing history, it seems to me that the whole issue turns on whether  accepts the concept of the analogue signal requirement of being continuous or not.  Since I am an engineer in the Aerospace industry, I though I would draw an analogy from that industry, that illustrated the point.  I was surprised to find that the analogy was turned on its head as will be revealed.  Every reference book I checked made the point that the analog signal had to be continuous (It was even in my Uni notes).  But to the analogy.    The Harrier aircraft uses mechanical wire linkages from the joystick to the control surfaces (elevator, ailerons & rudder).  This is, of course unarguably an analogue signalling system.  The wire linkage forms a continuous signal, and the control surfaces move in smooth continuous steps.  The Typhoon aircraft, in contrast, uses a digital system.  The position of the pilot's joystick is digitised into a number which gets mashed around a bit by a computer.  The resultant digital signal is then fed to the control surface via what is essentially a stepper hydraulic system.  Both the signals and the movement of the control surfaces are described in all the manuals as digital, in spite of the bit size of the numbers being large enough that the movement may appear to be smooth to the pilot.  The surprise was that in the preamble notes (the part of the manual given to new starters as part of their training), the operation of the digital control contained an explanetary analogy where the system was likened to """"... a clock with analogue hands where the movement of the hands is in fact discontinuous and hence, not really analogue at all.""""  In the subject context, the movement of the hands on a clock that has discontinuous movement (i.e. the majority of clocks) is not analogue and  is wrong to continue to insist that it is.   ""","""

0,55,3256,"""  Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted.  I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.  Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor.

 I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.
 Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases.

Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    ""","""==Notability of Umera Ahmed==
 A tag has been placed on Umera Ahmed requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 Outline of knowledge WikiProject update - 04/02/2009 

Hi everyone.

Things are going slow again.  Where have you been?!

Maybe what you need to get you going is a little competition...

 Who are we competing with? 

Encyclopedia Britannica.  Specifically, with its Outline of knowledge (presented in its volume called the Propaedia).  Currently, they're kicking our asses.  You've really got to check out their Outline of Knowledge (available only in the encyclopedia's paper edition - not the online version).

Portals. Informally, of course, just for the fun of it.  There are around 600 portals.  We're about 100 behind them, with about 500 outlines.  Let's blow past them and leave 'em in the dust!

 Confusion in editors at large 

Now that the country outlines have been moved to the encyclopedia proper (article space), recruiting help on these is of high priority  it will soon be time to alert all relevant editors to the nature and function of these and how they relate to other country coverage on Wikipedia.

However, I've noticed instances in which editors do not understand the nature and function of outline pages, and complain that they are redundant to articles.  Well, ya.  (That's the point of an outline - to provide the essentials in a structure for greater understanding, for easy viewing and faster reading, and to provide a topical guide).  

A few editors over the years have viewed outlines as redundant to portals, not understanding the purpose and scope of outlines, nor the benefits provided by their structure and standardization.

These problems of misunderstanding need to be solved before """"going public"""", to prevent their expansion as the community's awareness of these pages increases.  Consider the response we'd get now if we announced these pages on the talk pages of 500 WikiProjects, 500 article talk pages, and placed links in 500 see also sections, etc.

That could be a nightmare.

So...

 Encyclopedic and administrative support 

I've been working on a couple things that will help alleviate confusion and hopefully reduce the need for editors to ask questions and seek advice.   They're drafts, still under construction.  Please look these over and jump in and help complete them (directly or by providing feedback):

First is an  article draft, intended to replace the current Outline article.

Next is a  on the Outline of knowledge and its outline pages.

Let me know what you think.  Do they help you understand outlines better and how to develop them on Wikipedia?  What is missing?  How can they be improved?

The principle of permitting anonymous editing makes us vulnerable; it is necessary for those working on certain topics, but there it might have to be assured by some confidential mechanism for assigning names.

I returned to Wikipedia with this account as I said in my first contribution that """"[t]he first course of action I must take is pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was blocked before I had settled that matter. I had not had the chance to become a constructive editor because I was not finished with my pursuit of justice. However, cum laude I left my streak on Bode Miller to the first sentence with my only mainspace edit. My contribution to that renowned, reformed skier will prevail for many years to come. My first argument against my block is that Jpgordon, an involved administrator, blocked me. This is an utter no-no on Wikipedia — an involved administrator, who himself is the epitome of most administrators (abusive, unkind, and unjust [not a personal attack]), blocking someone he dislikes. Through my praxeological observations, I have realized that Josh clearly demonstrates cui bono. By this unjust block, Wikipedia is regressing, I daresay, regressing into the reign of terror.  I propose that this block be dealt with in one of two of the following ways: My block be reduced to one month, several months, or even a year. If I really am not a constructive editor, I wouldn't return. As devoted as I am, I will always strive to become useful here. My block be lifted. I will strive to make constructive additions to Bode Miller and other great Olympians. I will refrain from editing any talk pages so that I will not have any chance to """"troll"""" or """"harass"""". If I ever start trolling again, block me forthwith. After a couple months, allow me to edit talk pages again so I can work to develop mutual understanding with my fellow Wikipedians. Once I do anything you do not like, block me. How much vandalism can I inflict when at least six administrators are watching me?  My last request is that an uninvolved administrator adjudicate between Jpgordon and me. , , ,  (for their posts on my talk page) and  and  (for their posts at the Administrators' noticeboard) are now involved, so please find an uninvolved administrator to review this.   If you worry about my not being constructive if I am unblocked, I ask that whoever is handling this request exsert those worries. After having been blocked for """"[d]isruptive editing"""" on my previous account, I returned with this one. I returned to make amends. I returned to set right everything I disordered. I returned to assert my concerns. I returned with the hope of maintaining this stately encyclopedia, and I partially fulfilled this here. I would like to continue perfecting this great community. My last hope when I returned was to get blocked again, this time indefinitely, but instead to participate in the creation of an online encyclopedia destined to become the essence of Internet, the essence of knowledge, and the essence of perfection.  As Carl Rogers once said, """"If we value independence, if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our present system induces, then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness, for self-direction, and for self-initiated learning"""". I believe just that and hope to introduce it to the Wikipedia community.  I sincerely apologize for my attacks (as you put them) at administrators. To , if you find problem with my username, if I get unblocked, I will be open to changing my username. I am a man true to my word, so don't hesitate to unblock me. Thanks,    ""","""

This is an utter no-no on Wikipedia — an involved administrator, who himself is the epitome of most administrators (abusive, unkind, and unjust [not a personal attack]), blocking someone he dislikes. Through my praxeological observations, I have realized that Josh clearly demonstrates cui bono. By this unjust block, Wikipedia is regressing, I daresay, regressing into the reign of terror.

I propose that this block be dealt with in one of two of the following ways:
My block be reduced to one month, several months, or even a year. If I really am not a constructive editor, I wouldn't return. As devoted as I am, I will always strive to become useful here.
My block be lifted. I will strive to make constructive additions to Bode Miller and other great Olympians. I will refrain from editing any talk pages so that I will not have any chance to """"troll"""" or """"harass"""". If I ever start trolling again, block me forthwith. After a couple months, allow me to edit talk pages again so I can work to develop mutual understanding with my fellow Wikipedians. Once I do anything you do not like, block me. How much vandalism can I inflict when at least six administrators are watching me?

My last request is that an uninvolved administrator adjudicate between Jpgordon and me. , , ,  (for their posts on my talk page) and  and  (for their posts at the Administrators' noticeboard) are now involved, so please find an uninvolved administrator to review this. 

If you worry about my not being constructive if I am unblocked, I ask that whoever is handling this request exsert those worries. After having been blocked for """"[d]isruptive editing"""" on my previous account, I returned with this one. I returned to make amends. I returned to set right everything I disordered. I returned to assert my concerns. I returned with the hope of maintaining this stately encyclopedia, and I partially fulfilled this here. I would like to continue perfecting this great community. My last hope when I returned was to get blocked again, this time indefinitely, but instead to participate in the creation of an online encyclopedia destined to become the essence of Internet, the essence of knowledge, and the essence of perfection.

As Carl Rogers once said, """"If we value independence, if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our present system induces, then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness, for self-direction, and for self-initiated learning"""". I believe just that and hope to introduce it to the Wikipedia community.

I sincerely apologize for my attacks (as you put them) at administrators. To , if you find problem with my username, if I get unblocked, I will be open to changing my username.
I am a man true to my word, so don't hesitate to unblock me.

This said it seems we both have too much time to sit on our heads, and we're going to a pretty pointless discussion, the likes of which, I really abhor. Let's agree on two ground rules. They are sensible, and I think you will accept them. 1) STICK WITH YOUR POINTS. This means that if you think something and state it, you'll recognize you took a hit and acknowledge refutation when refutation is produced. Otherwise, you'll be doing the Apollo Hoax, 2012 stunt, of responding to refutation by going off into a completely different direction, being refuted again resulting in new, fresh and wilder claims. 2) DEFINE A THRESHOLD BY WHICH YOU'LL ACCEPT YOU ARE WRONG. By this point in the discussion the items of disagreement should be clear to you, and refutation of all of them will mean you are wrong. Right?

About other links to the site under dispute. You seem to think you are making sort of a naughty threat about them as in """"One of these days I might have a look at some of them to check whether they qualify,"""" but you fail to notice that if you decree the specific site unreliable here (and I am talking of reliable only) the site is unreliable everywhere in Wikipedia. You need not bother yourself removing the links, because I'll remove them myself. Ain't that what I did when going ballistic? Perhaps one hindrance with them though, is that instead of hinging on your own personal sense of taste and style, those other links deal with mathematics and physics, abiding by the usual standards of proof, that anyone with a bit of knowledge of math and physics can check.

0,66,4714,"""  Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]  I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to.  I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you.  I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own.  Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting.  If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say.  So do the wisest, just shut up!  It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand.  All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing.  Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light.  I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept.  You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit.  As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name.  They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous.  So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.  So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own?  I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another.  Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule?  It is all a lie.  How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group?  It isnt equality it is power struggle.  It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here.  WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!  HA HA!  Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies.  Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""".  For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first.  I speak 9 languages:  English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!  5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm.

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm.

If you check the links they are all to legitimate secondary sources, and the chances they have been tampered with are remote. No reasons why such tampering might occur have been advanced.

The sources for the article span various publications and television programs, so whether they span the web is perhaps not a major consideration. Nevertheless, if other supporting links are available, they should be used in preference. I think it should also be pointed out, as has already been pointed out, that one user who removed the links claiming they were improper, later restored one of those links, because he wished to use it to support an argument.

And, of course, anyone with access to the publications may check the accuracy, and bring any problems to the attention of editors. The sources for the article span various publications and television programs, so whether they span the web is perhaps not a major consideration. Nevertheless, if other supporting links are available, they should be used in preference. I think it should also be pointed out, as has already been pointed out, that one user who removed the links claiming they were improper, later restored one of those links, because he wished to use it to support an argument. So there is clear evidence of inconsistency by those rejecting these links. That said, users now appear satisfied that the links may remain (to be replaced if and when other links become available), so I would hope that this issue does not need to be reopened without good reason.

Dear Mr Freeman

I am writing to thank you for your letter of 21 March and hope to hear future feedback on our tumble dryers.

I wish to express my utter apology for the poor standard of our tumble dryers that you recently have received. I assure you that the fault was not of the manufacturers, but of the transport company that we hire to deliver our products. The tumble dryers left our company in perfect condition, and therefore were not properly packaged into the lorries and were damaged in the journey. As for the colour schemes, we are to believe that the tumble dryers were being delivered along side some cans of paint and must have got mixed up along the way.

We will have a word with the delivery company to sort out the problem and so future deliveries should arrive in the high standard expected of our company.

In the meantime might we interest you in some exclusive discount vouchers on future orders. Find enclosed our brochure.

0,71,3823,"""Is Ethylene Glycol a Synonym for Antifreeze?  Update 2 My intent in editing out the extraneous information of ethylene glycol poisoning in the Antifreeze article is that many editors and visitors to the Article are of the impression that all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol. This is a misconception. Case in point? Look above at the comments made by Flyer22 and TechnoSymbiosis. 1. Note that they mention articles in which the poisonous chemical is the Article in question. 2. Lead, Mercury (element), Asbestos, Benzodiazepine, paracetamol. That is a list of six 5 chemical substances and asbestos, which is virtually a chemical species for the purposes of this discussion. 3. Note also that the article in question here is not about a specific chemical, rather it is about a wide range of substances including the poisonous and deadly methanol and ethylene glycol. The article isn't about a chemical species like mercury or lead. It is about liquids (plural) which have special properties in commerce and mechanics and discusses practical applications of chemicals.  So when auto mechanics or airplane mechanics discuss antifreeze, or when chemists discuss it or talk about it, this poisoning aspect is a rare but useful part of the discussion. It is only when talking about this topic medically that the need arises to discuss the many symptoms and embark upon long-winded treatises on what happens internally to a person intoxicated on a particular antifreeze. In commercial, practical, and chemical discussions, the fact that something is toxic arises obtusely to the main concern.  Take those ethylene glycol warnings to the Ethylene glycol page and (if there was any sudden interest in it) to the Methanol article, which would be consistent with the 6 examples listed above. As a sideline, why aren't there any warnings of the deadliness of methanol, which is soooooo poisonous that it takes 10 mL of it to blind a person, and 30 mL to kill. Sounds pretty notable by the above standards, so let's list all of the symptoms in the antifreeze article, too. Or not. That would be borderline absurd, since the ethylene glycol lobby dictates that ethylene glycol is synonymous with Antifreeze.  Another absurd corollary would be to go to the Thermal insulation page and discuss how poisonous Asbestos is. I mean, all insulation is asbestos, right?  To summarize, this argument is about the scope of Antifreeze. I don't think this scope encompasses the symptoms of poisoning (from a particular type of antifreeze) which happen to be so difficult to spot that they deserve the full attention available at the Good Article named Ethylene glycol poisoning where all of the nuances of medical research and diagnosis can be discussed at length.      So fix the misconception, don't just blank an entire section.     Most antifreeze is still ethylene glycol. It's hardly an obscure risk.       No one is or has stated that """"ethylene glycol is a synonym for antifreeze."""" And the misconception that """"all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol"""" can also be mentioned in the aforementioned section, although I have not read anyone in the discussions about this on this talk page express any misconception (especially since you've expressd such concerns before). Somehow, you are completely missing the point about why you are wrong to repeatedly remove this information. The point is that ethylene glycol poisoning, which is a part of this article, causes these symtoms; and therefore, there should be an appropriate summary of these symptoms, per WP:Summary style, before pointing readers to the article about it. It is not """"extraneous information."""" So once again, I will contact WP:MED to comment here on this issue.

However, as far as the specific point over whether it relates to the article: harmony cannot exist without intervals.

Harmony and interval relationships are inseparable, because they're one and the same. So absolutely, a section explaining intervals is relevant.

For the large percentage of the population who struggles with learning things """"by ear"""", a comfortably firm understanding of interval relationships is (along with practice thereafter) the magic key to unlocking the ability to """"hear"""" (discern) harmonies.

0,46,1289,"In 1988 a Wide Use Campaign was introduced by republican senator, Mark Hatfield. The Wide Use Campaign supported unrestricted access to timber and other resources. Wise Use activists exploited the population’s fear of job and property security loss. The Campaign placed a barrier between workers and environmentalists. The Wide Use Campaign used bumper stickers, phone-ins and faxes to promote their views. Wise Use and Republicans kicked off anti-environmentalism. The recession that began in 1990 enhanced anti-green and pro-industry views. A group called Alliance for America was created with 125 anti-environment and pro-industry groups. In 1994, the US did not pass a Biodiversity Treaty.  Another group that was created in the 90’s was called Earth Day Alternatives. They were also counter-environmentalists. This group labelled environmentalists as “anti-human” and extremists.  The Earth Day Alternative group promoted three things. They aimed to privatise resources for exploitation, advocate pollution to be permitted as trade between companies, to discredit environmental science. Heritage was a group that was also created with a laissez-faire approach toward the environment.  Anti-environmentalists were motivated by the fact that the ICI created deceptive green advertising.","In 1988 a Wide Use Campaign was introduced by republican senator, Mark Hatfield.

The Campaign placed a barrier between workers and environmentalists. The Wide Use Campaign used bumper stickers, phone-ins and faxes to promote their views. Wise Use and Republicans kicked off anti-environmentalism.
The recession that began in 1990 enhanced anti-green and pro-industry views. A group called Alliance for America was created with 125 anti-environment and pro-industry groups. In 1994, the US did not pass a Biodiversity Treaty.  Another group that was created in the 90’s was called Earth Day Alternatives. They were also counter-environmentalists. This group labelled environmentalists as “anti-human” and extremists.  The Earth Day Alternative group promoted three things. They aimed to privatise resources for exploitation, advocate pollution to be permitted as trade between companies, to discredit environmental science. Heritage was a group that was also created with a laissez-faire approach toward the environment.

Thank you for taking the time to make your comments. The recognition of your """"Having professionals who contribute their talents at Wikipedia is a great thing and helps advance the project"""" comment is most appreciated and highly agreed upon.

Unfortunately the involvement of contributors such as 'BertieBasset' ( who should be deprived computer access and is hopefully sterile for the sake of future generations ) detracts from the efforts of well-meaning professionals and truly hinders the betterment of the project through their moronic lack of vision or intelligence and professional or quality editing ability.

That being said, regrettably it would be best for ALL images to be deleted at this time as per your extended courtesy. No further contributions will be made and it will be remembered as a failed attempt to improve a deserving site due to the ignorance of those amateurs like 'BertieBasset'.
